Followin imporvements can be done:
1) Currently, server program doesn't check for active agents/peers.
Solution : I have made PeerAgentAvl.java which checks availibility of port on remote machine.
           This logic can be incorporated easily into Server.java to solve above limitation.

2) Currently, If multiple peers have same file, then peer can download from single peer only i.e. Data chuncking is not available.
Solution : Here is good link that explains how BitTorrent handles such thing :
